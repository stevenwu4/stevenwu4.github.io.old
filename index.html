        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="post-avatar" src="img/me.jpg" height="128" width="96">
        <ul>
            <li>Graduated B. Mathematics, Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics degree @ <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>. Interesting classes taken include: Data Mining I, Spatial Statistics, Time Series Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Systems Programming, Software Engineering.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Currently working as a Technical Services Developer @ <a href="http://www.360pi.com">360pi</a>. On previous co-op terms I started with manual quality assurance and ended working on test automation. Almost everything that I have learned and know about Python and programming is thanks to the inspiration and advice of my very smart and very friendly coworkers.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In total, have been a teaching assistant for 14 different 1st year/2nd year mathematics/statistics classes. I've worked as a Co-op Peer Helper on a voluntary basis for a year and I also worked as a Campus Tour Guide for a year.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm currently employed at the Centre for Quantitative Analysis and Decision Support at Carleton University. We're in the very early stages, but our Sports Statistics team is performing research for <a href="./blog_posts">blog</a> articles to launch our upcoming website. Stay tuned! The first article will be a tutorial of scraping CFL data using Python + web technologies BeautifulSoup and Selenium.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm working on a set of programs, implemented using Python/R/MongoDB, to leverage CIS play-by-play data. In its state on the web, analysis can't be performed. How can you calculate a player's +/- if you're not sure he's in the game or not? After seeing one too many instances of a player who "enters the game" twice, I developed algorithms to automatically clean a game, and most importantly, guarantee 10 players on the court at all times. I've also developed metrics that justify the changes I make to the games.</li>
