        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="post-avatar" src="img/me.jpg" height="128" width="96">
        <ul>
            <li>I'm currently finishing my B. Mathematics, Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics degree @ <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>. Interesting classes taken include: Data Mining I, Spatial Statistics, Time Series Analysis, Systems Programming, Software Engineering. I'm wrapping up my last term taking Fundamental Web Applications, Database Management Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Statistical Computing, and my Honours Project.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have 16 months of co-op work experience @ <a href="http://www.360pi.com">360pi</a>. I started with manual quality assurance and ended working on test automation. Almost everything that I have learned and know about Python and programming is thanks to the inspiration and advice of my very smart and very friendly past coworkers.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In total, have been a teaching assistant for 14 different 1st year/2nd year mathematics/statistics classes. I've worked as a Co-op Peer Helper on a voluntary basis for a year and I also worked as a Campus Tour Guide for a year.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm currently employed at the Centre for Quantitative Analysis and Decision Support at Carleton University. We're in the very early stages, but our Sports Statistics team is performing research for <a href="./blog_posts">blog</a> articles to launch our upcoming website.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm working on a set of programs, implemented using Python/R/MongoDB, to leverage CIS play-by-play data. In its state on the web, analysis can't be performed. How can you calculate a player's +/- if you're not sure he's in the game or not? After seeing one too many instances of a player who "enters the game" twice, I developed algorithms to automatically clean a game, and most importantly, guarantee 10 players on the court at all times. I've also developed metrics that justify the changes I make to the games.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continuing to survive under the shadows of my <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/mae/wp-content/uploads/2012_09_21_Xijia_Wu_Bio.pdf">dad</a> and <a href="http://www.med.nyu.edu/mbgrad/Students.html">my</a> <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/publications/connect-information-technology/2014/12/02/nyu-tries-to--hack--ebola.html">sister</a>.
